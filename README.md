# Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA-
🧠 Definition PCA is a Dimensionality Reduction technique used in Machine Learning and statistics.  ✅ It transforms a large set of features (variables) into a smaller set of new features called principal components, while retaining most of the important information in the dataset.  

🎯 Why Do We Need PCA? When we deal with data having too many features (high dimensions):

🚨 Some features may be redundant or irrelevant. 🐢 High-dimensional data increases computation time (curse of dimensionality). 🤯 It's hard to visualize data beyond 3 dimensions. PCA helps us: ✅ Compress data into fewer dimensions. ✅ Remove noise and redundancy. ✅ Visualize high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D.
